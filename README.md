## Building

Assuming you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) version 7 or higher, clone this repository and run `npm install` in it. Then run `npm run build` and point your browser to the `index.html`

Note that the links to blog posts omit `.html` so you'll need to change the URL in your browser to be able to see them, or modify your server to accommodate this (see [this](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7761779) if you're using nginx).
